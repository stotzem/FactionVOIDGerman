The active development of this project has moved to Codeberg:

üîó **[[RH2] Faction: V.O.I.D. German / Deutsch on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/stotzem/FactionVOIDGerman)**

## Why the Move?

This project has been migrated to Codeberg as I support Codeberg's mission of providing a free and open platform for software development run by a non-profit organization.

**One of the key reasons for this move is my decision to avoid US-based companies and services where possible,** due to concerns about:

- Data privacy and surveillance laws
- Corporate governance and ethical considerations
- Long-term sustainability of open-source projects under commercial entities
- Supporting non-profit, community-driven alternatives
